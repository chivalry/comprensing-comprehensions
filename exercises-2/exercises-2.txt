(1) Given a list of integers, use a list comprehension
    to calculate the sum of the factorials of those integers.

n! = n-1 * n-2 * n-3 ... 1

5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

[3, 4, 5]

3! = 3*2*1 = 6
4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24
5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120

(+ 6 24 120)

(2) From mini-access-log.txt, create a list of the IP
    addresses in that file.

(3) Create a dictionary (or a variant thereof -- such
    as Counter) in which the keys are the IP addresses
    and the values are the number of times that each
    IP address appeared in the file.  Use the resulting
    dict/Counter to print each IP address and its times

(4) Create, from linux-etc-passwd.txt, a list of tuples
    in which each tuple is (username, user_id) .
    username is field index 0, user_id is field index 2
